                <div class="about--me__body">
                    <p>Since art is such a personal part of a person's life and I believe that to know the art you have to know the person so a quick introduction of me.
                        I am eighteen years old and a student of the British University of Bahrain(BUB), I'm also from the Kingdom of Bahrain and have lived there for my 
                        entire life. However, for a more in-depth description of me, I will give a quick rundown of how I grew up, I am the youngest and have three siblings
                        and I grew up with a single mom since my dad passed away when I was too young to remember. So, throughout my life, I grew up very isolated from my
                        family not due to any resentment, but more so because the age gap between me and my siblings ranges from six to thirteen years
                        old and they had grown up when my father was still alive so it created a disconnect between us. You would think that this feeling of being isolated
                        pushed me to art but, that would be incorrect</p>

                    <p>I have only been consistently drawing since the age of sixteen and I had started drawing not as a way to deal with the isolation but more so to 
                        help me sort my thoughts. Because my starting to draw had coincided with my last years in high school so I had a lot of stress to deal with and
                        such I needed an outlet for my stress.</p>
